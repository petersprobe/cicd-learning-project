# CI/CD Learning Project

Welcome to your CI/CD learning journey! This project will teach you the fundamentals of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment through hands-on practice.

## What is CI/CD?

**CI (Continuous Integration):** The practice of automatically building and testing code changes as they are committed to a repository.

**CD (Continuous Deployment):** The practice of automatically deploying code changes to production environments after passing all tests.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Fundamentals
- [x] Project setup and structure
- [ ] Understanding CI/CD concepts
- [ ] Version control with Git
- [ ] Basic testing strategies

### Phase 2: CI/CD Tools
- [ ] GitHub Actions
- [ ] Jenkins
- [ ] GitLab CI
- [ ] Azure DevOps

### Phase 3: Advanced Concepts
- [ ] Docker containers
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- [ ] Security scanning
- [ ] Monitoring and observability

```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository** (if you haven't already)
2. **Follow the learning modules** in the `docs/` directory
3. **Complete the exercises** in the `exercises/` directory
4. **Practice with the sample application** in the `app/` directory

## Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd cicd

# Set up the sample application
cd app
npm install
npm start

# Explore the CI/CD pipelines
cd ../pipelines
```

## Learning Resources

- **Documentation**: Check the `docs/` folder for detailed guides
- **Exercises**: Practice with hands-on exercises in `exercises/`
- **Sample App**: Use the web application in `app/` to test your pipelines

## Next Steps

1. Read through the documentation in `docs/`
2. Complete the exercises in order
3. Set up your own CI/CD pipeline
4. Practice with different tools and scenarios

Happy learning! ðŸš€
